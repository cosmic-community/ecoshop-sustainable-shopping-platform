## Prompts

This application was built using the following prompts to generate the content structure and code:

### Content Model Prompt

> "Eco-Friendly Shopping App: Complete Specification
Core Concept Overview
Your app enforces sustainable shopping practices through a two-stage verification system before payment, promoting jute/paper bag usage and preventing fraudulent weight manipulation.
>
> System Architecture & Features
Stage 1: Sustainable Bag Verification
Purpose: Ensure only eco-friendly bags (jute or paper) are used
>
> Implementation Approach:
>
> Computer Vision AI: Use machine learning models (similar to existing jute bag detection models on Roboflow) to identify bag material‚Äã
>
> Camera Integration: Real-time scanning through smartphone camera
>
> Material Classification:
>
> ‚úÖ Approved: Jute bags, paper bags, cloth bags
>
> ‚ùå Rejected: Plastic bags, synthetic materials
>
> Visual Feedback: Green checkmark for approved, red X for rejected materials
>
> Technical Features:
>
> Multi-angle scanning for accuracy
>
> Texture and pattern recognition
>
> Material database with 95%+ accuracy
>
> Quick scan (2-3 seconds)
>
> Stage 2: Anti-Fraud Weight Monitoring
Purpose: Prevent shoplifting by detecting static/unchanged weights
>
> Implementation Approach:
>
> Bluetooth Weight Sensors: Similar to AppWeigh technology for real-time weight monitoring‚Äã
>
> Dynamic Weight Tracking: Continuous monitoring during shopping
>
> Fraud Detection Algorithm:
>
> Tracks weight changes every 2-3 seconds
>
> Flags if weight remains identical for extended period (suggests bag switch or item removal)
>
> Requires minimum 3+ weight variations during shopping session
>
> Smart Detection Rules:
>
> ‚úÖ Normal: Weight increases as items added, minor fluctuations
>
> ‚ö†Ô∏è Suspicious: Weight constant for >2 minutes while "shopping"
>
> ‚ùå Blocked: Weight decreases or no variation throughout session
>
> Technical Features:
>
> Real-time Bluetooth connectivity
>
> Weight history graph visualization
>
> Calibration system for different bag weights
>
> Tamper alerts
>
> Stage 3: Secure Payment Integration
Payment Flow:
>
> Only accessible after passing both verification stages
>
> Multiple payment options: UPI, cards, digital wallets
>
> Receipt generation with eco-impact metrics
>
> Loyalty points for consistent sustainable shopping
>
> Additional Essential Features
1. Eco-Impact Dashboard
Personal carbon footprint reduction tracker
>
> Plastic bags avoided counter
>
> Trees saved equivalent
>
> Monthly sustainability score
>
> Community leaderboard
>
> 2. Smart Shopping Assistant
Barcode scanner for product info
>
> Sustainability ratings for products
>
> Alternative eco-friendly product suggestions
>
> Package recyclability information
>
> 3. Reward System
Points for using eco-friendly bags
>
> Bonus for consistent weight validation
>
> Redeemable at partner stores
>
> Achievement badges (Eco Warrior, Green Champion)
>
> 4. Store Integration Features
QR code check-in at store entry
>
> Digital shopping list
>
> Aisle navigation
>
> Real-time inventory check
>
> 5. Community Features
Share eco-achievements on social media
